# CK3: Prisoners and Jailors

In this mod for Crusader Kings 3, players engage in a dynamic trade through offering or demanding prisoners as bargaining chips from other rulers in exchange for favors or gold.

Rulers can offer prisoners through an interaction, giving them away, seeking gold or gaining weak hooks in return. Conversely, they can demand prisoners, potentially receiving significant sums of gold or strong hooks. Opinion modifiers and their innate value reflect how prisoners are perceived, whether traded to allies, enemies, or family members, affecting relationships and dynamics within the game.

This mod enhances player agency, allowing for strategic maneuvers like acquiring important characters, strategic hooks, or influencing wars through prisoner exchanges and decisions on their fate.

These interactions are similar to personally imprisoning the prisoners yourself, whether it's in releasing them or acting as a bridge to the cycle of release, recapture, and reimprisonment tedium. They will incur penalties. 

With that said, these balance values strictly derive from existing numbers pertaining to hostile, vassal, and hostage interactions. However, while they are intended to be, do inform me if they seem "unfair" or "unrewarding".

## 🗺️ Roadmap
I have temporarily removed these features to ensure compatibility with other mods:
- Prisoner Traveling System
- Events Related to Travel System
- Travel System Game Rules
- Exchange Prisoner Interaction

I may consider reintroducing them once the new DLC is released or if some of you guys want to try it, however.

## ❓ FAQ

#### ❔ Why do they cost less than the ransom interaction?

> For balance reasons, this mechanic is way too powerful. I did implement something that will reward you more if you interact with the appropriate ruler.
> Unless you have other mods that interact with imprisonment, the AI lacks a genuine incentive to accept prisoners, aside from being at war. Consequently, they wouldn't really benefit from its use; they would promptly ransom prisoners as soon as they can.

#### ❔ How did you come up with these values?

> These balance values strictly are derived from existing numbers related to hostile, vassal, and hostage interactions.
> Notes are provided above each modifier within the code, indicating the source of the values. However, if there are no such notes, it is solely a decision made by me.

#### ❔ Isn't there a mod similar to this already?

> Yes, however, it lacks some features that I desire or that I plan to implement in the future. Since everything is written from scratch, it is also highly customizable should you ever wish to add, modify, or maintain it yourself.

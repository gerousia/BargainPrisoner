# CK3: Prisoners and Jailors

#### Ransom, Offer or Demand Prisoners from other rulers in exchange for favors or gold.

These interactions are <u>similar to personally imprisoning the prisoners yourself</u> — acting as a bridge to the tedium release/ransom-capture-imprisonment cycle. This action *may* incur penalties.

The prison's values are **weighted by several factors derived from in-game values** pertaining to hostile, vassal, and hostage interactions. 

Prisoners of [interest](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3161565481/4330853251136044372/) will be sold from one ruler to another for *title stripping*, *forced marriages*, or even *recruitment*. The AI will always seek prisoners they are at war with to capture.

**Influence what's happening around you**. Since imprisonment will be more penalizing, this mod now also allow Players to ransom *anyone*.

#### However, while they are intended to be *balanced*, do inform me if they seem 'unfair' or 'unrewarding'.

## 🔧 Mod Features

These interactions affects both parties, and gaining opinions from war participants, as you decide the fate of their war, makes prisoners more valuable than simply releasing them; you can now obtain or ransom any prisoners you want, provided they accept.

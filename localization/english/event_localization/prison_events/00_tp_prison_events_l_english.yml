 tp_prison.9002.t:0 "Freedom!"
 tp_prison.9002.desc_1:0 "I spend many days planning my escape, thinking about the best course of action and route of escape. It all amounts to nothing though as one day my travelling bodyguard simply forgets to lock my shackles, staggering away without looking back."

 tp_prison.9002.desc_2:0 "A nice word here, a heartfelt compliment there – soon the guard views me with warm familiarity instead of the initial suspicion [scope_travel_bodyguard.GetSheHe] harbored. When I ask for a bit of fresh air [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] does not even question me, and I leave [dummy_gender.GetHerHim] face down in a ditch."
 
 tp_prison.9002.desc_3_opening:0 "A moments distraction, that was all I needed to slip the keyring from the guard's belt and behind my back."
 tp_prison.9002.desc_3_a:0 "When darkness falls I slowly ease my shackles open, wincing at the screech."
 #tp_prison.9002.desc_3_b:0 "When darkness falls I make my way slowly out of my cell, wincing at the screech."

 tp_prison.9002.desc_4:0 "I scour every inch of my shackles. I inspect every hinges, tracing along every crevice, and investigate each chain. As darkness once again falls I finally find what I've been looking for– a loose chain! It is quick work to loosen the chains after that."

 tp_prison.9002.desc_5:0 "I navigate the route, every path as familiar as an old friend, patiently biding my time. I am well-acquainted with the movements, knowing what goes where and at what time. Familiar with the specific travelers who tread upon certain paths, I am aware of the fastest route out of the [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip]. As darkness descends, I patiently wait for the opportune moment, slipping away like a shadow when it finally arrives."

 tp_prison.9002.desc_6:0 "I wait until darkness falls, and as soon as I am certain no one is around, I seize the chains that shackle me with both hands and  #EMP snap#!. Beads of sweat trickle into my eyes, and my panting breath echoes in the darkness. Before long, I achieve a slight breakage, just enough to break free."

 tp_prison.9002.desc_7:0 "As soon as the guard leaves, I descend upon the lock. It's old and rusty, and all I have to work with is a small stick I found while we were traveling, but that will not stop me. A small twist, a tiny nudge, and– #EMP there!#!"
 
 tp_prison.9002.desc_8:0 "I smile as the guard tries to stifle a yawn. While resting, I have kept the discussion going for hours by now, and I dive into the topic of [ROOT.Char.Custom('subject_of_interest')] without relenting. Soon [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is nodding in [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] place, and then it's a simple thing to get the keys of [dummy_gender.GetHerHim]."

 tp_prison.9002.desc_9:0 "Many days of sly gazes, insinuating gestures, and invitations have finally born fruit, and as the guard approach me with one hand already unlacing [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] [dummy_gender.Custom('GetUpperClothingArticle')] I smile. It is a painless thing, to pass out in the throes of bliss, and I make sure to cause no undue harm."

 tp_prison.9002.desc_ending_1:0 "\n\nAs I disappear into the [imprisoner.Custom('TerrainType')] surrounding [imprisoner.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] [imprisoner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')] I finally dare to hope."
 tp_prison.9002.desc_ending_2:0 "\n\nAs I disappear into the night, when I am far away from all, I tilt my head back and laugh."

 tp_prison.9002.a:0 "I am free!"

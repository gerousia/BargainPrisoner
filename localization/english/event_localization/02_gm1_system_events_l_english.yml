## Attempt Escape Success
### You escaped!
 gm1_system.0501.t: "Freedom!"
 gm1_system.0501.desc_1: "I spend many days planning my escape, thinking about the best course of action and route of escape. It all amounts to nothing though as one day [escort.GetFirstName] simply forgets to lock my shackles. I stagger away without looking back."
 gm1_system.0501.desc_2: "A nice word here, a heartfelt compliment there – soon my bodyguard views me with warm familiarity instead of the initial suspicion [escort.GetSheHe] harbored. When I ask for a bit of fresh air [escort.GetSheHe] does not even question me, and I leave [escort.GetHerHim] face down in a ditch."
 gm1_system.0501.desc_4: "I scour every inch of my shackles. I inspect every hinges, tracing along every crevice, and investigate each chain. As darkness once again falls I finally find what I've been looking for– a loose chain! It is quick work to loosen the chains after that."
 gm1_system.0501.desc_5_1: "Treading along the route, I felt that this path feels earily familiar, similar as an old friend. These trees, every boulder that lay-"
 gm1_system.0501.desc_5_2: "#EMPI REMEMBER!#! Well-acquainted with my surroundings- knowing what path goes and where it leads. I know where the fastest route out of [THIS.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip] is!"
 gm1_system.0501.desc_5_3: "As darkness descends, I patiently wait for the opportune moment, slipping away like a shadow when it finally arrives."
 gm1_system.0501.desc_6_1: "I wait until darkness falls, and as soon as I am certain [escort.GetFirstName] isn't nearby, I seize the chains that shackle me with both hands and #EMP snap#!." 
 gm1_system.0501.desc_6_2: "Beads of sweat trickle into my eyes, quivering my panting breath as it dimly echoes into the wilderness. Before long, I achieve a slight breakage, just enough to break free."
 gm1_system.0501.desc_7_a: "As soon as [escort.GetFirstName] turns, I descend upon the lock. It's old and rusty, and all I have to work with is a small stick I found laying on the dirt, but that will not stop me. A small twist, a tiny nudge, and– #EMP THERE!#!"
 gm1_system.0501.desc_7_b: "A moments distraction, that was all I needed to slip the keyring from [escort.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] belt to behind my back.\n\nWhen darkness falls I slowly ease my shackles open, wincing at the screech."
 gm1_system.0501.desc_8_1: "I smile as the guard tries to stifle a yawn. While resting, I have kept the discussion going for hours by now, and I dive into the topic of [THIS.Char.Custom('subject_of_interest')] without relenting."
 gm1_system.0501.desc_8_2: "Soon [escort.GetFirstName] is nodding in [escort.GetHerHis] place, and then it's a simple thing to get the keys off [escort.GetHerHim]."
 gm1_system.0501.desc_9_1: "Many days of sly gazes, insinuating gestures, and invitations have finally born fruit, and as [escort.GetFirstName] approach me with one hand already unlacing [escort.GetHerHis] [escort.Custom('GetUpperClothingArticle')] I smile."
 gm1_system.0501.desc_9_2: "It is a painless thing, to pass out in the throes of bliss, and I make sure to cause no undue harm."
 gm1_system.0501.outro_a: "\n\nAs I disappear into the [THIS.Custom('TerrainType')] surrounding [THIS.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip]. I finally dare to hope."
 gm1_system.0501.outro_b: "\n\nAs I disappear into the night, when I am far away from [escort.GetFirstName], I tilt my head back and laugh."
 gm1_system.0501.a: "I am free!"

### Your escort is dead!
 gm1_system.0502.t: "Freedom!"
 gm1_system.0502.desc_1: "A fortunate string of luck, as I watch my escort, [escort.GetFirstName], ceased [escort.GetHerHis] last breath on our journy towards [receiver.GetCapitalLocation.GetNameNoTooltip]."
 gm1_system.0502.desc_2: "\n\nNow, unaccompanied, I stand amidst the wilderness, a prisoner #EMP unchained#! no more."
 gm1_system.0502.a: "I am free!"

### This is the jailor's perspective.
 gm1_system.0999.t: "Escaped!"
 gm1_system.0999.desc_a: "My prisoner, [escapee.GetTitledFirstName], escaped while traveling towards [receiver.GetTitledFirstName] court!"
 gm1_system.0999.desc_b: "My prisoner, [escapee.GetTitledFirstName], escaped while traveling back from [receiver.GetTitledFirstName] court!"
 gm1_system.0999.outro: "\n\n[escort.GetFirstName], [escapee.GetHerHis] accompanying escort, have nothing to say in their defense, but the damage is already done nonetheless."
 gm1_system.0999.a: "Curse you, [escapee.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"

## Attempt Escape Failure
### You got caught!
 gm1_system.1001.t: "Unbreakable Chains"
 gm1_system.1001.desc_1: "As [escort.GetFirstName] is momentarily distracted I reach for the keyring hanging on the [escort.GetHerHis] belt, but a firm hand stops me halfway."
 gm1_system.1001.desc_2: "\n\n"Oh no no. There's no escaping here, #EMP my [THIS.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]#!. "[escort.GetHerHis|U] sneers down at me and laughs."
 gm1_system.1001.desc_3: "\n\n"You thought the gruel you were getting was bad? Just you wait.""
 gm1_system.1001.a: "I may never escape..."

### You got hurt!
 gm1_system.1002.t: "Pushing Boundaries"
 gm1_system.1002.intro: "It is becoming clear to me that must take my fate in my own hands. It is also clear that not every part of the walls are equally well guarded."
 gm1_system.1002.desc_a: "\n\nAfter a nasty fall from a steep river, I do wish it was, however. It took an hour before someone found me and helped me, where a healer was called."
 gm1_system.1002.desc_b: "\n\nI soon discovered, however, that the woods beyond the road are dark and confusing. It was only after numerous scrapes and branches struck with my head I managed to find the way out, back into [escort.GetFirstName]..."
 gm1_system.1002.a: "I'm... I'm still alive...!"

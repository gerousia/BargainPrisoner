		## If you're wondering why this section is bare...
		##
		## The AI, even with prisoners having strong claims 
		## against their major titles, are dumb as fuck.
		## The Ai has no idea what to do with the prisoner.
		##
		## They won't:
		##  1. Strip prisoner claims.
		##  2. Execute the prisoner.
		##
		## On really RARE occasions though they WILL do these.
		## IF the stars and planets align in their favor-
		## as well as their mamas and papas bless them as
		## their golden child.
		##
		## But most likely they will:
		##  1. Set them free for virtually nothing. :)
		##  2. Ransom the prisoner for less their worth.
		##
		## Pls PDX improve base AI :)
